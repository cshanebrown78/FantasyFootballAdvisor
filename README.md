# Fantasy Football Advisor

## Overview

This is an App developed as part of a project for our coding bootcamp class.  At this point in the development it is intended to help new people to Fantasy Football with their draft.  The app requires users to set up an "account" and then on the draft page they can use that page to do mock drafts or they can also use it during the draft.  Each position will show the top 5 available players.  The user can then click the 'draft' button to draft to their team or click the 'drafted' if the player is drafted to another team.  If either button is pushed the player is then removed from the available players lists.
